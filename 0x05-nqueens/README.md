N Queens Problem
The N Queens problem is a classic puzzle in computer science and mathematics, where the objective is to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. This project aims to implement a solution to the N Queens problem using Python, focusing on backtracking algorithms and recursive functions.

Concepts Needed
Backtracking Algorithms: Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
Recursion: Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
List Manipulations in Python: Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
Python Command Line Arguments: Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
Additional Resources
To enhance your understanding and skills, consider exploring the following resources:

Mock Interview: Practice solving similar problems through mock interviews.
Algorithmic Thinking: Learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
Requirements
Editors: Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
Environment: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.
PEP 8 Style: Code should adhere to the PEP 8 style guide.
Executable Files: All files must be executable.
README.md: A mandatory README.md file should be included at the root of the project folder.
Tasks
N queens
Implement a program that solves the N Queens problem.
Usage: nqueens N
If the user provides the wrong number of arguments, print the appropriate error message and exit with status 1.
If N is not an integer or is smaller than 4, print the respective error messages and exit with status 1.
Print every possible solution to the problem, one solution per line.
