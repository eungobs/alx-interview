WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv
ChatGPT
It looks like you've successfully installed the bcrypt package. However, there's a warning that you're running pip as the 'root' user, which can potentially lead to broken permissions and conflicts with the system package manager.

To avoid these issues, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Virtual environments provide a isolated environment for your Python projects, ensuring that packages are installed cleanly without affecting system-wide packages or permissions.

Here's how you can create and activate a virtual environment to install packages without using the 'root' user:

Install virtualenv if you haven't already:
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
Create a new virtual environment:
Copy code
virtualenv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Linux/Mac:
bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
On Windows:
Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages using pip without any warnings about running as the 'root' user. For example:
Copy code
pip install bcrypt
By using virtual environments, you can ensure that your Python projects remain isolated and maintain clean package installations.

help me to write a good README.md for the following:Tasks
0. User model
mandatory
In this task you will create a SQLAlchemy model named User for a database table named users (by using the mapping declaration of SQLAlchemy).

The model will have the following attributes:

id, the integer primary key
email, a non-nullable string
hashed_password, a non-nullable string
session_id, a nullable string
reset_token, a nullable string

In this task, you will complete the DB class provided below to implement the add_user method.

"""DB module
"""
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.orm.session import Session

Note that DB._session is a private property and hence should NEVER be used from outside the DB class.

Implement the add_user method, which has two required string arguments: email and hashed_password, and returns a User object. The method should save the user to the database. No validations are required at this stage.

2. Find user
mandatory
In this task you will implement the DB.find_user_by method. This method takes in arbitrary keyword arguments and returns the first row found in the users table as filtered by the method’s input arguments. No validation of input arguments required at this point.

Make sure that SQLAlchemy’s NoResultFound and InvalidRequestError are raised when no results are found, or when wrong query arguments are passed, respectively.

Warning:

3. update user
mandatory
In this task, you will implement the DB.update_user method that takes as argument a required user_id integer and arbitrary keyword arguments, and returns None.

The method will use find_user_by to locate the user to update, then will update the user’s attributes as passed in the method’s arguments then commit changes to the database.

If an argument that does not correspond to a user attribute is passed, raise a ValueError.

class Auth:
    """Auth class to interact with the authentication database.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._db = DB()
Note that Auth._db is a private property and should NEVER be used from outside the class.

Auth.register_user should take mandatory email and password string arguments and return a User object.

If a user already exist with the passed email, raise a ValueError with the message User <user's email> already exists.

If not, hash the password with _hash_password, save the user to the database using self._db and return the User object.

File: auth.py
  
6. Basic Flask app
mandatory
In this task, you will set up a basic Flask app.

Create a Flask app that has a single GET route ("/") and use flask.jsonify to return a JSON payload of the form:

{"message": "Bienvenue"}
Add the following code at the end of the module:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port="5000")
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-user-data
Directory: 0x03-user_authentication_service
File: app.py
  
7. Register user
mandatory
In this task, you will implement the end-point to register a user. Define a users function that implements the POST /users route.

Import the Auth object and instantiate it at the root of the module as such:

from auth import Auth


AUTH = Auth()
The end-point should expect two form data fields: "email" and "password". If the user does not exist, the end-point should register it and respond with the following JSON payload:

{"email": "<registered email>", "message": "user created"}
If the user is already registered, catch the exception and return a JSON payload of the form

{"message": "email already registered"}
and return a 400 status code

Remember that you should only use AUTH in this app. DB is a lower abstraction that is proxied by Auth.

mandatory

Note that the method is private to the auth module and should NOT be used outside of it.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-user-data

10. Get session ID
mandatory
In this task, you will implement the Auth.create_session method. It takes an email string argument and returns the session ID as a string.

The method should find the user corresponding to the email, generate a new UUID and store it in the database as the user’s session_id, then return the session ID.

Remember that only public methods of self._db can be used.

The request is expected to contain form data with "email" and a "password" fields.

If the login information is incorrect, use flask.abort to respond with a 401 HTTP status.

Otherwise, create a new session for the user, store it the session ID as a cookie with key "session_id" on the response and return a JSON payload of the form

0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
Overview
This project aims to implement an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The task requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

Concepts Needed
Matrix Representation in Python: Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python and accessing/modifying elements in a 2D matrix.
In-place Operations: Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure and minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
Matrix Transposition: Concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns) and implementing it as a step in the rotation process.
Reversing Rows in a Matrix: Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
Nested Loops: Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices and modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.

Additional Resources
Mock Technical Interview: Get familiar with the interview-style questions and problems.

Tasks
0. Rotate 2D Matrix: Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. Do not return anything; the matrix must be edited in-place.
