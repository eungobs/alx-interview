Minimum Operations

Overview
This project focuses on solving a problem where you need to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The problem involves dynamic programming and mathematical concepts such as prime factorization, code optimization, and greedy algorithms.

Concepts Needed
To tackle this problem effectively, you'll need to understand the following key concepts:

Dynamic Programming: Helps in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
Prime Factorization: Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.
Code Optimization: Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
Greedy Algorithms: The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
Basic Python Programming: Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should be documented

Tasks
0. Minimum Operations
Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)

Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
Example:
python

n = 9

# H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
# Number of operations: 6

minOperations(n)
Usage

$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
