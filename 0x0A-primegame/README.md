Prime Game Project README
Hey there! Welcome to the README for the Prime Game project. Here, I'll walk you through what this project is all about and what you'll need to know to tackle it like a pro.

Introduction
So, in this project, we're diving into prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization. Our mission? To solve a competitive game scenario where we strategically remove prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

What's the Challenge?
Here's the deal: We've got to figure out who wins a game based on the smart removal of prime numbers. Imagine Maria and Ben playing a game. They start with a set of consecutive integers, and they take turns picking prime numbers from the set and removing them along with their multiples. The player who can't make a move anymore loses the game.

What Do I Need to Know?
Prime Numbers
First up, prime numbers. We need to know what they are and how to identify them efficiently within a range.

Sieve of Eratosthenes
Ever heard of this cool algorithm? It's a super-efficient way to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. And it's going to be handy for our task.

Game Theory
Get ready for some strategic thinking! We'll need to understand the basics of competitive games, optimal play, and what it takes to win.

Dynamic Programming/Memoization
This is all about optimization. We'll use previous results to speed up future calculations. It might be crucial for optimizing our solution, especially for multiple rounds of the game.

Python Programming
Of course, we'll be doing all this in Python. So, brush up on your loops, conditionals, arrays, and lists.

Where Can I Learn More?
Prime Numbers and Sieve of Eratosthenes
Check out resources like Khan Academy for a primer on prime numbers. And for the Sieve of Eratosthenes, there are plenty of guides and tutorials online.

Game Theory Basics
You'll find some straightforward explanations of game theory principles out there. Understanding how games work and how to win them is key.

Python Official Documentation
Don't forget the official Python documentation. It's a goldmine of information on lists and everything else Python-related.

Ready to Dive In?
Armed with these concepts and some recommended resources, you'll be all set to tackle this project. Success will come from applying efficient algorithms, managing the game state effectively, and making those optimal decisions.

Any Questions?
If you're unsure about anything or need clarification on a concept, don't hesitate to ask. We're in this together!

Let's Do This!
Enough talk; let's jump into the world of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization. I can't wait to see what we'll accomplish!
