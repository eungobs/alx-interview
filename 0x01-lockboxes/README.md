Lockboxes

This repository contains solutions to the Lockboxes problem, part of the Algorithm track at Holberton School.

Concepts Needed
To tackle this project effectively, you'll need to have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

Lists and List Manipulation: Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
Graph Theory Basics: Knowledge of graph theory, especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search, can be helpful.
Algorithmic Complexity: Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is crucial for writing efficient algorithms.
Recursion: Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
Queue and Stack: Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing traversal algorithms.
Set Operations: Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
