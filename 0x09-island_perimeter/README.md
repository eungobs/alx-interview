0x09. Island Perimeter

Description

In the "0. Island Perimeter" project, you'll leverage your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to tackle a geometric problem within a grid context. The primary objective is to compute the perimeter of a single island in a grid, represented by a 2D array of integers. Mastery of navigating and analyzing 2D arrays, along with applying logical operations to determine perimeter conditions, is essential for this task.

Concepts Needed

2D Arrays (Matrices):
Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

Conditional Logic:
Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

Counting Techniques:
Developing a method to count the edges contributing to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

Problem-Solving Strategies:
Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

Python Programming:
Utilizing nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
Employing conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

By understanding these concepts and utilizing provided resources, you'll be equipped to tackle the problem methodically. You'll need to iterate over the grid, apply logical operations to identify the island's perimeter, and account for specific conditions outlined in the task. This project not only tests your algorithmic thinking but also reinforces your ability to manipulate data structures and apply logical reasoning to solve problems.
